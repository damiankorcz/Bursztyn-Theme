This is my Personal Theme for Obsidian.md.

I don't intend on adding anything to the theme that I don't personally use / benefit from. The goal is to keep this theme closely aligned with the default theme and not add too many changes. A "set and forget" kind of theme. Compared to my other theme ([Prism](https://github.com/damiankorcz/Prism-Theme)), I hope to keep this one without Style Settings and will borrow some styling / features from Prism.
